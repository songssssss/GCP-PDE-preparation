Question #21
Topic 1
Your company uses a proprietary system to send inventory data every 6 hours to a data ingestion service in the cloud. Transmitted data includes a payload of several fields and the timestamp of the transmission. If there are any concerns about a transmission, the system re-transmits the data. How should you deduplicate the data most efficiency?
A. Assign global unique identifiers (GUID) to each data entry. Most Voted
B. Compute the hash value of each data entry, and compare it with all historical data.
C. Store each data entry as the primary key in a separate database and apply an index.
D. Maintain a database table to store the hash value and other metadata for each data entry. Most Voted
 
To deduplicate the data efficiently in this scenario, the best approach would be:

### **A. Assign global unique identifiers (GUID) to each data entry.**

### Explanation:
Using GUIDs (or UUIDs) ensures that each entry is uniquely identifiable, making it easy to track and manage individual data entries. This method allows you to quickly check if an entry already exists in your database by simply comparing the GUIDs, which is efficient and avoids the overhead of computing hashes or managing separate hash tables.

### Other Options Considered:
- **B. Compute the hash value of each data entry**: This could work, but it requires comparing the hash against all historical data, which can be computationally expensive as the data grows.
  
- **C. Store each data entry as the primary key in a separate database**: While this might prevent duplicates, it doesn’t inherently resolve the issue of managing deduplication efficiently.

- **D. Maintain a database table to store the hash value and other metadata**: This is a viable option, but it still involves additional overhead for managing the hash values and checking against them.

### Conclusion:
While options B and D have their merits, option A stands out as the most straightforward and efficient method for deduplication in this scenario. If you have more questions or need further clarification, feel free to ask!

## Q41

For READ operation it's is correct. i.e. Date#Device (so that data read from single node) -
For write operation it should be DeviceID#Date (so that data write via multiple nodes)

The strategy you've outlined for optimizing read and write operations in Google Cloud Bigtable by structuring the row key differently for reads and writes is a common and effective approach known as "time series data modeling." This approach aims to improve read and write performance by considering the access patterns of the data.

### Read Operation - Date#Device:

- **Row Key Format: Date#Device**
  - When designing the row key for read operations, you've chosen to structure it as Date#Device.
  - This design allows you to efficiently retrieve data for a specific date and device together.
  - By combining the date and device in the row key, you can read data from a single node, enhancing read performance for queries that require data related to a specific date and device.

### Write Operation - DeviceID#Date:

- **Row Key Format: DeviceID#Date**
  - For write operations, you've chosen to structure the row key as DeviceID#Date.
  - This design aims to distribute writes across multiple nodes by including DeviceID first in the row key.
  - By starting with DeviceID in the row key, you can achieve better write scalability as writes related to different devices are spread across partitions, allowing for concurrent writes to different devices without creating hotspots.

### Benefits of this Approach:

1. **Optimized Read Performance:**
   - The Date#Device row key structure facilitates efficient retrieval of data for a specific date and device, enhancing read performance by reading from a single node.

2. **Improved Write Scalability:**
   - The DeviceID#Date row key structure helps distribute write operations across multiple nodes, improving write scalability by avoiding hotspots and allowing for concurrent writes to different devices.

3. **Balanced Data Distribution:**
   - By considering the access patterns for reads and writes, this approach balances data distribution and optimizes performance for both operations.

4. **Query Flexibility:**
   - The chosen row key formats provide flexibility for querying data based on either date or device, supporting different types of queries efficiently.

By structuring the row key differently for read and write operations in Google Cloud Bigtable based on the specific requirements of your application, you can optimize performance, scalability, and overall efficiency when reading and writing time series data.

## Q42
**Does Spark support MapReduce?**  
Apache Spark is a fast and general-purpose cluster computing system that provides high-level APIs in Java, Scala, Python, and R. While Spark does not directly use MapReduce for its processing, it can run on top of Hadoop YARN clusters and can also process data stored in HDFS. Spark provides its own distributed computing framework that is faster than traditional MapReduce due to its in-memory processing capabilities and DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) execution engine.

**Differences between Pig and Spark:**

1. **Processing Model:**
   - **Pig:** Apache Pig is a data flow language that converts high-level Pig Latin scripts into MapReduce jobs for execution on Hadoop clusters. It is primarily designed for batch processing.
   - **Spark:** Apache Spark is a unified analytics engine for big data processing that provides support for batch processing, real-time processing, machine learning, and interactive queries. It uses an in-memory computation model and can process data faster than MapReduce.

2. **Execution Speed:**
   - **Pig:** Pig scripts are translated into MapReduce jobs, which can lead to slower processing times due to disk I/O involved in each MapReduce job.
   - **Spark:** Spark processes data in-memory and uses lazy evaluation and transformations through its RDD (Resilient Distributed Dataset) abstraction, leading to faster processing times compared to MapReduce and Pig.

3. **Programming Model:**
   - **Pig:** Pig Latin is a data flow language that is SQL-like and provides a high-level abstraction for data processing tasks.
   - **Spark:** Spark provides high-level APIs in Java, Scala, Python, and R. It supports a variety of programming languages and APIs, including DataFrames, Datasets, and Spark SQL.

4. **Fault Tolerance:**
   - **Pig:** Apache Pig relies on Hadoop's fault tolerance mechanisms built into the MapReduce framework.
   - **Spark:** Spark provides fault tolerance through lineage information stored for RDDs, enabling efficient recovery in case of node failures.

5. **Ease of Use:**
   - **Pig:** Pig is relatively easy to learn for those familiar with SQL-like languages. It abstracts the complexity of MapReduce programming.
   - **Spark:** Spark offers a more versatile and flexible programming model, but it may have a steeper learning curve compared to Pig.

In summary, while both Apache Pig and Apache Spark are tools for data processing on Hadoop clusters, they differ in their processing models, execution speed, fault tolerance mechanisms, programming languages, and ease of use. Spark is known for its speed and versatility, especially for in-memory processing, while Pig provides a simpler abstraction layer for data processing tasks.

## Q44
Excluding the time component when indexing a datetime field or timestamp can be a strategic decision based on the specific requirements of your application. Here are some reasons why you might choose to exclude the time component from indexing:

1. **Query Simplicity**: If your queries typically do not involve the time component or do not require precise time comparisons, excluding the time component can simplify your queries and indexing strategy.

2. **Reduced Index Size**: Excluding the time component can reduce the size of the index data structure, potentially saving storage space and improving query performance by making the index more compact.

3. **Aggregation Queries**: For scenarios where you need to aggregate data based on dates (e.g., daily, monthly), excluding the time component can make these aggregation queries easier and more efficient.

4. **Query Consistency**: Excluding the time component can help ensure that queries based on dates are consistent, especially if time precision is not necessary for your use case.

5. **Index Efficiency**: If queries primarily focus on date-based comparisons and ordering, excluding the time component can make the index more efficient and better optimized for those types of queries.

6. **Query Flexibility**: By excluding the time component, you can focus on date-based queries and potentially handle different time zones or date ranges more effectively.

7. **Simplified Logic**: Excluding the time component can simplify the logic for date-based queries, making it easier to work with and reducing the complexity of query construction.

However, it's essential to consider your specific use case and query patterns when deciding whether to exclude the time component from indexing. If your application requires precise time-based queries or if the time component is crucial for your data analysis, excluding the time component may not be appropriate.

Ultimately, the decision to exclude the time component from indexing should be based on a careful evaluation of your application's requirements, query patterns, and the trade-offs between query simplicity, index efficiency, and data accuracy.

## Q45
C. Create a cron job with Google App Engine Cron Service to run the Cloud Dataflow job.
Using the Google App Engine Cron Service to run the Cloud Dataflow job allows you to automate the execution of the job. By creating a cron job, you can ensure that the Dataflow job is triggered exactly once per day at a specified time. This approach is automated, reliable, and fits the requirement of processing the log file once per day.
Actually, google recommends Dataflow over Dataproc for both batch and streaming. Dataproc is only recommended if you are coming from
hadoop, spark, ....

The App Engine Cron Service allows you to configure regularly scheduled tasks that operate at defined times or regular intervals. These tasks are commonly known as cron jobs. These cron jobs are automatically triggered by the App Engine Cron Service. For instance, you might use this to send out a report email on a daily basis, to update some cached data every 10 minutes, or to update some summary information once an hour.

A cron job makes a scheduled HTTP GET request to the specified endpoint in the same app where the cron job is configured. The handler for that endpoint executes the logic when it is called.

The App Engine Cron Service cannot be used to call web endpoints outside the App Engine host app. It cannot be used to call App Engine endpoints from other apps besides the host app.

Cron job requests are subject to the same limits as other HTTP requests . Free applications can have up to 20 scheduled tasks. Paid applications can have up to 250 scheduled tasks.

## Q50
NoSQL: HBase, Cassandra, MongDB, Redis
Redis is limited to 1 TB capacity quota per region. So it doesn't satisfy the requirement.

NoSQL, telemetry data, IoT, high availability and low latency, not require ACID 
HBase, Cassandra, MongDB

A. Redis - Redis is an in-memory non-relational key-value store. Redis is a great choice for implementing a highly available in-memory cache to decrease data access latency, increase throughput, and ease the load off your relational or NoSQL database and application. Since the question does not ask cache,
E. Cassandra - Apache Cassandra is an open source NoSQL distributed database trusted by thousands of companies for scalability and high availability without compromising performance. Linear scalability and proven fault-tolerance on commodity hardware or cloud infrastructure make it the perfect platform for mission-critical data.
F. HDFS with Hive - Hive allows users to read, write, and manage petabytes of data using SQL. Hive is built on top of Apache Hadoop, which is an open-source framework used to efficiently store and process large datasets. As a result, Hive is closely integrated with Hadoop, and is designed to work quickly on petabytes of data. HIVE IS NOT A DATABSE.

Hive: data warehouse infrastructure
Apache Hadoop is an open-source framework designed for distributed storage and processing of large datasets across clusters of commodity hardware.

BigQuery query plan: 
Purple is reading, Blue is writing

Group by queries in BigQuery can run slowly when there is significant data skew on the grouped columns. Since the query is grouping by country, if most rows have the same country value, all that data will need to be shuffled to a single reducer to perform the aggregation. This can cause a data skew slowdown.

For unbound collection, this will fail if any aggregation function is done

Beam’s default windowing behavior is to assign all elements of a PCollection to a single, global window and discard late data
even for unbounded PCollections. Before you use a grouping transform such as GroupByKey on an unbounded PCollection, you must do at least
one of the following:
—->>>>>>Set a non-global windowing function. See Setting your PCollection’s windowing function.
Set a non-default trigger. This allows the global window to emit results under other conditions, since the default windowing behavior (waiting for
all data to arrive) will never occur.
—->>>>If you don’t set a non-global windowing function or a non-default trigger for your unbounded PCollection and subsequently use a
grouping transform such as GroupByKey or Combine, your pipeline will generate an error upon construction and your job will fail. Global windowing is the default behavior,

## Q58
Cloud SQL would be the most appropriate choice for the online retailer in this scenario. Cloud SQL is a fully-managed relational database service that allows for easy management and analysis of data using SQL. It is well-suited for applications built on Google App Engine and can handle the transactional workload of an e-commerce application, as well as the analytical workload of a BI tool.

BigQuery is good for the analysis part but it's not good for managing transactions. If the question needed a database just to store the data for analysis it would be ok. But if we want to update single transactions or add them row by row, then it's not good. BigQuery is not made to support an application. It's a DW.

# By default, preemptible node disk sizes are limited to 100GB or the size of the non-preemptible node disk sizes, whichever is smaller.
However you can override the default preemptible disk size to any requested size. Since the majority of our cluster is using preemptible nodes,
the size of the disk used for caching operations will see a noticeable performance improvement using a larger disk. Also, SSD's will perform
better than HDD. This will increase costs slightly, but is the best option available while maintaining costs.

## Q148
AutoML is used to train model and do damage detection
Auto Vision is used is a pre trained model used to detect objects in images

AutoML:
Custom Model Training: AutoML allows users to train custom machine learning models tailored to specific datasets and use cases. It's designed for users who may not have extensive machine learning expertise but want to create specialized models.
Cloud Vision API:
Pre-trained Models: The Cloud Vision API provides access to pre-trained machine learning models for common tasks such as image labeling, text detection, face detection, and object localization. It’s ready to use without the need for additional training.


Answer is B. Train an AutoML model on your corpus of images, and build an API around that model to integrate with the package tracking applications.

For this scenario, where you need to automate the detection of damaged packages in real time while they are in transit, the most suitable solution among the provided options would be B.

Here's why this option is the most appropriate:

Real-Time Analysis: AutoML provides the capability to train a custom model specifically tailored to recognize patterns of damage in packages. This model can process images in real-time, which is essential in your scenario.

Integration with Existing Systems: By building an API around the AutoML model, you can seamlessly integrate this solution with your existing package tracking applications. This ensures that the system can flag damaged packages for human review efficiently.

Customization and Accuracy: Since the model is trained on your specific corpus of images, it can be more accurate in detecting damages relevant to your use case compared to pre-trained models.

Let's briefly consider why the other options are less suitable:
A. Use BigQuery machine learning: BigQuery is great for handling large-scale data analytics but is not optimized for real-time image processing or complex image recognition tasks like damage detection on packages.

C. Use the Cloud Vision API: While the Cloud Vision API is powerful for general image analysis, it might not be as effective for the specific task of detecting damage on packages, which requires a more customized approach.

D. Use TensorFlow in Cloud Datalab: While this is a viable option for creating a custom model, it might be more complex and time-consuming compared to using AutoML. Additionally, setting up a real-time analysis system through a Python notebook might not be as straightforward as an API integration.

## Q154
Cloud SQL using MySQL. You need to ensure high availability in the event of a zone failure
Failover Replica: By creating a failover replica in another zone within the same region, you establish a high-availability configuration. The failover replica is kept in sync with the primary instance, and it can quickly take over in case of a failure of the primary instance.
Same Region: Placing the failover replica in the same region ensures minimal latency and data consistency. In the event of a zone failure, the failover can happen within the same region, reducing potential downtime.
Zone Resilience: Google Cloud's regional design ensures that zones within a region are independent of each other, which adds resilience to zone failures.
Automatic Failover: In case of a primary instance failure, Cloud SQL will automatically promote the failover replica to become the new primary instance, minimizing downtime.

## Q212
The best approach would be to check if there is a firewall rule allowing traffic on TCP ports 12345 and 12346 for the Dataflow network tag. Dataflow uses TCP ports 12345 and 12346 for communication between worker nodes. Using network tags and associated firewall rules is a Google recommended security practice for controlling access between Compute Engine instances like Dataflow workers.

## Q21
In BigQuery, when partitioning a table, you can only use **one column** to create partitioned tables. This column is typically a timestamp or date column, which allows you to effectively manage and query large datasets based on time.

### Types of Partitioning:

1. **Time-based Partitioning**: This is the most common method and is used with columns of type `DATE`, `DATETIME`, or `TIMESTAMP`. You can partition by day, month, or year.

2. **Integer Range Partitioning**: You can also partition a table using an integer column. This method allows you to specify ranges of integer values.

### Additional Considerations:

- **Clustering**: While you can only partition by one column, you can apply clustering on additional columns. Clustering allows you to organize data within the partitions, which can improve query performance.

- **Best Practices**: Choose a partitioning column that reduces the amount of data scanned during queries, optimizing both performance and cost.

---
## Q214
The best option is B - Create a Standard Tier Memorystore for Redis instance in a development environment. Initiate a manual failover by using the
force-data-loss data protection mode.
The key points are:
• The failover should be tested in a separate development environment, not production, to avoid impacting real data.
• The force-data-loss mode will simulate a full failover and restart, which is the most accurate test of disaster recovery.
• Limited-data-loss mode only fails over reads which does not fully test write capabilities.
• Increasing replicas in production and failing over (C) risks losing real production data.
• Failing over production (D) also risks impacting real data and traffic.
So option B isolates the test from production and uses the most rigorous failover mode to fully validate disaster recovery capabilities.

Capacity Restoration: Promoting the Region2 replica makes it the new primary. You need to replicate from this new primary to maintain redundancy and capacity. Creating two replicas (Region3, new region) accomplishes this.
Geographic Distribution: Distributing replicas across regions ensures availability if another regional event occurs.
Speed: Creating new replicas from the promoted primary is likely faster than promoting another existing replica.
When you promote a read replica in Cloud SQL for PostgreSQL, that read replica becomes the new primary instance. After the promotion, the former read replica is no longer a read replica; it is now a standalone primary instance. 

### Key Points:

1. **Promotion**: When you promote a read replica, it is transitioned to become the primary instance. It stops replicating from the original primary and operates independently.

2. **Read Replicas**: Once a read replica is promoted, it cannot act as a read replica for the original primary instance anymore. You would need to create new read replicas from the newly promoted primary instance if you want additional read capacity.

3. **Capacity**: After the promotion, if you need to maintain or increase your read capacity, you should create new read replicas from the newly promoted primary instance to distribute read loads effectively.

### Summary

In short, after promoting a read replica, it cannot serve as a read replica anymore, and you would need to establish new replicas for redundancy and load balancing. If you have further questions or need more details, feel free to ask!

## Q219
To receive notifications when a task in your Cloud Composer (Apache Airflow) DAG does not succeed, the best approach is:

### **C. Assign a function with notification logic to the `on_failure_callback` parameter for the operator responsible for the task at risk.**

### Rationale:

- **`on_failure_callback`**: This parameter allows you to specify a function that will be executed whenever the task fails. You can implement notification logic within this function to alert you when the task does not succeed, making it a direct and effective solution for failure notifications.

### Why Not the Others?

- **A**: The `on_retry_callback` parameter is called when a task is retried, not when it fails. This wouldn't be appropriate for notifications about task failures.

- **B**: While configuring a Cloud Monitoring alert based on the `sla_missed` metric is useful for tracking SLA violations, it doesn't specifically notify you of task failures. It's more about ensuring tasks meet certain performance thresholds.

- **D**: The `sla_miss_callback` parameter is used to handle situations where a task misses its specified SLA (Service Level Agreement), which is different from a task simply failing. It may not cover all failure scenarios.

### Summary

Using the `on_failure_callback` allows for targeted and immediate notifications in response to task failures, making it the best option for your scenario. If you have any more questions or need further clarification, feel free to ask!

## Q224
Processing Speed: This refers to how quickly individual messages (click events) are processed once they are read from the Pub/Sub topic. If the Dataflow job is able to process messages in less than 30 seconds, that means each message can be handled relatively quickly.

Data Freshness: This refers to the time it takes for messages to go from being published to being available for consumption by downstream services (in this case, the advertising department). It considers the total time from when the event occurs to when the result is available to the consumer.

Based on the scenario you've described, the most appropriate option is:

### **C. Messages in your Dataflow job are processed in less than 30 seconds, but your job cannot keep up with the backlog in the Pub/Sub subscription. Optimize your job or increase the number of workers to fix this.**

### Rationale:

- **Processing Time vs. Freshness**: You mentioned that the Dataflow job's system lag is about 5 seconds, and data freshness is about 40 seconds. While individual messages may be processed in under 30 seconds, the cumulative effect of processing delays suggests that your job is not keeping up with the incoming message rate.

- **Backlog**: The backlog in the Pub/Sub subscription indicates that messages are being produced faster than they are being processed. Even if each message is processed quickly, if the rate of incoming messages exceeds the processing capacity, it results in delays for the messages being sent to the advertising department.

### Suggested Actions:

1. **Optimize the Dataflow Job**: Review your transformations to ensure they are efficient. Look for any bottlenecks that could be improved.

2. **Increase Workers**: Scaling up the number of workers in your Dataflow job can help improve throughput and reduce the time it takes to process the backlog.

3. **Monitor Metrics**: Use monitoring tools to observe the metrics of your Dataflow job, such as processing time, backlog size, and throughput, to identify specific areas for improvement.

### Why Not the Others?

- **A**: There’s no indication that the advertising department is causing delays, as the issue seems to lie with the processing capacity of the Dataflow job.

- **B**: While optimizing the job or increasing workers can help, the main issue appears to be related to the backlog rather than processing time exceeding 30 seconds.

- **D**: There’s no evidence provided that the web server isn’t pushing messages fast enough; the problem seems to be with message consumption rather than production.

### Summary

Option C addresses the core issue of backlog and processing capacity, which is critical for ensuring timely delivery of messages to the advertising department. If you have further questions or need more clarification, feel free to ask!

## Q226
VPC Service Controls are a security feature in Google Cloud that allows you to define a security perimeter around your Google Cloud resources to help mitigate data exfiltration risks. The differences between the two options you provided relate to the scope and application of the VPC Service Controls.

### A. Configure VPC Service Controls in the organization with a perimeter around the VPC of project A.

- **Scope**: This option sets the security perimeter specifically around the VPC network that is associated with Project A.
- **Focus**: It restricts access to resources based on the VPC. Resources within this VPC can have additional security measures to prevent unauthorized access or data exfiltration, focusing on network-level isolation.
- **Use Case**: Useful if your primary concern is securing resources at the network level, especially when there are multiple projects that share VPCs or if you have specific VPC configurations that you want to protect.

### B. Configure VPC Service Controls in the organization with a perimeter around project A.

- **Scope**: This option sets the security perimeter around all resources within Project A, regardless of the VPC configuration.
- **Focus**: It restricts access to all resources in Project A, including data stored in Google Cloud services like BigQuery, Cloud Storage, etc., ensuring that these resources can only be accessed by authorized users and services.
- **Use Case**: Ideal for a broader security approach, ensuring that all data and resources within the project are protected, irrespective of the VPC setup.

### Summary of Differences

- **Level of Security**: Option A focuses on securing the VPC and associated resources at the network level, while Option B focuses on securing all resources within Project A, regardless of their VPC configuration.
- **Resource Coverage**: Option A is specific to the VPC’s configurations and security, whereas Option B covers all resources in the project, including those that may not be directly related to the VPC.
- **Complexity and Flexibility**: Option A may allow for more granular control over network traffic, while Option B provides a simpler, more comprehensive security model for all project resources.

Choosing between these options depends on your security needs and architecture. If you have more questions or need further clarification, feel free to ask!

## Q227
Scalability for Read-Only Clients: Read replicas distribute read traffic across multiple instances, significantly enhancing read capacity to support  large number of clients without impacting write performance.
High Availability: Standard Tier ensures high availability with automatic failover, minimizing downtime in case of instance failure.
Minimal Code Changes: Redis clients can seamlessly connect to read replicas without requiring extensive code modifications, enabling a quick
deployment.

BAsic tier doesn't provide HA.
B. Create a new Memorystore for Redis instance with Standard Tier. Set capacity to 5 GB and create multiple read replicas. Delete the old instance.
Rationale:
Standard Tier: This tier offers high availability with automatic failover and supports read replicas, which is crucial for handling increased read traffic efficiently.

Increased Capacity: Setting the capacity to 5 GB provides more memory to handle a larger dataset and more simultaneous read requests from multiple clients without performance degradation.

Multiple Read Replicas: By creating multiple read replicas, you can distribute the read load, ensuring that no single instance becomes a bottleneck. This is particularly important as the number of clients grows significantly.

Minimal Downtime: Deploying a new instance allows for a smooth transition without interrupting existing services. Once the new instance is operational and validated, you can safely delete the old instance.

## Q228
In the context of Google Cloud Pub/Sub, **seek** is a feature that allows you to replay messages in a subscription by moving the acknowledgment (ack) cursor back to a specific point in time or to a specific snapshot. This is particularly useful for scenarios where you need to reprocess messages due to updates in your application logic or if there was an issue with message processing.

### Key Aspects of Seek:

1. **Replay Messages**: When you seek to a specific timestamp, you can reprocess messages that were published before that timestamp. This allows you to effectively "rewind" to a point in time and handle the messages again.

2. **Snapshots**: You can also seek to a snapshot, which captures the state of a subscription at a certain time. This is helpful for capturing a specific moment's data for reprocessing.

3. **Use Cases**:
   - **Updating Business Logic**: If you improve your message processing logic, you can seek back to reprocess old messages.
   - **Error Handling**: If an error occurred during processing, seeking back allows you to reattempt processing without losing messages.

4. **Limits**: The seek operation only applies to acknowledged messages that are retained in the subscription's backlog. This means that if a message has already been acknowledged and the retention period has passed, it may not be available for replay.

### How to Use Seek

- You typically use the seek feature in your application by specifying either a timestamp or a snapshot ID through the Pub/Sub client libraries or REST API.

### Summary

Seek is a powerful feature that enhances the flexibility and robustness of message processing in Pub/Sub, allowing you to handle data changes and processing errors efficiently. If you have any more questions about this or related topics, feel free to ask!

## Q229

https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/materialized-views-create#non-incremental
In scenarios where data staleness is acceptable, for example for batch data processing or reporting, non-incremental materialized views can improve query performance and reduce cost.
`allow_non_incremental_definition` option. This option must be accompanied by the `max_staleness` option. To ensure a periodic refresh of the materialized view, you should also configure a refresh policy.
 data staleness and is better suited for heavy querying, thanks to the `allow_non_incremental_definition`
Precomputed Results: Materialized views store precomputed results of complex queries, significantly accelerating subsequent query performance, addressing the slow visualization issue.

- Allow Non-Incremental Views: Using allow_non_incremental_definition circumvents the limitation of incremental updates for outer joins and analytic functions, ensuring views can be created for the specified queries.
- Near-Real-Time Data: Setting max_staleness to 4 hours guarantees data freshness within the acceptable latency for visualizations.
- Automatic Refresh: Enabling refresh with enable_refresh maintains view consistency with minimal maintenance overhead.
- Minimal Overhead: Materialized views automatically update as underlying data changes, reducing maintenance compared to manual exports or view definitions.

## Q231
If an Airflow worker pod is evicted, all task instances running on that pod are interrupted, and later marked as failed by Airflow. The majority of issues with worker pod evictions happen because of out-of-memory situations in workers.
You might want to:
- (D) Increase the memory available to workers.
- (C) Reduce worker concurrency. In this way, a single worker handles fewer tasks at once. This provides more memory or storage to each individua task. If you change worker concurrency, you might also want to increase the maximum number of workers. In this way, the number of tasks that your environment can handle at once stays the same. For example, if you reduce worker Concurrency from 12 to 6, you might want to double the maximum number of workers.

## Q234

D. 1. Store the historical data in BigQuery for analytics.
2. In a Cloud SQL table, store the last state of the product after every product change.
3. Serve the last state data directly from Cloud SQL to the AP
This approach leverages BigQuery's scalability and efficiency for handling large datasets for analytics. BigQuery is well-suited for managing the 10
PB of historical product data. Meanwhile, Cloud SQL provides the necessary performance to handle the API queries with the required low latency.
By storing the latest state of each product in Cloud SQL, you can efficiently handle the high QPS with sub-second latency, which is crucial for the
API's performance. This combination of BigQuery and Cloud SQL offers a balanced solution for both the large-scale analytics and the highperformance API needs.

Serve the last state data directly from Cloud SQL to the API.
Here's why this option is most suitable:
BigQuery for Analytics: BigQuery is an excellent choice for storing and analyzing large datasets like your 10 PB of historical product data. It is designed for handling big data analytics efficiently and cost-effectively.
Cloud SQL for Last State Data: Cloud SQL is a fully managed relational database that can effectively handle the storage of the last known state of products. Storing this subset of data (about 10 GB) in Cloud SQL allows for optimized and faster query performance for your API needs. Cloud SQL can comfortably handle the requirement of up to 1000 QPS with sub-second latency.
Separation of Concerns: This approach separates the analytics workload (BigQuery) from the operational query workload (Cloud SQL). This separation ensures that analytics queries do not interfere with the operational performance of the API and vice versa.

## Q241
- Dual-region buckets are a specific type of storage that automatically replicates data between two geographically distinct regions.
- Turbo replication is an enhanced feature that provides faster replication between the two regions, thus minimizing RPO.
- This option ensures that your data is resilient to regional failures and is replicated quickly, meeting the needs for low RPO and no impact on application performance.

"Default replication in Cloud Storage is designed to provide redundancy across regions for 99.9% of newly written objects within a target of one hour and 100% of newly written objects within a target of 12 hours"
"When enabled, turbo replication is designed to replicate 100% of newly written objects to both regions that constitute the dual-region within the recovery point objective of 15 minutes, regardless of object size."
Thus, since they want to minimize RPO, should use turbo replication

---
## Q242

---
## Q251
- Setting a retention policy on a Cloud Storage bucket prevents objects from being deleted for the duration of the retention period.
- Locking the policy makes it immutable, meaning that the retention period cannot be reduced or removed, thus ensuring that the documents
cannot be deleted or overwritten until the retention period expires.

---
## Q252
- A denormalized, append-only model simplifies query complexity by eliminating the need for joins.
- Adding data with an ingestion timestamp allows for easy retrieval of both current and historical states.
- Instead of updating records, new records are appended, which maintains historical information without the need to create separate snapshots

---
## Q253
- Private Google Access for services allows VM instances with only internal IP addresses in a VPC network or on-premises networks (via Cloud VPN or Cloud Interconnect) to reach Google APIs and services.
- When you launch a Dataflow job, you can specify that it should use worker instances without external IP addresses if Private Google Access is enabled on the subnetwork where these instances are launched.
- This way, your Dataflow workers will be able to access Cloud Storage and BigQuery without violating the organizational constraint of no external IPs.
VPC Service Controls are typically used to define and enforce security perimeters around APIs and services, restricting their access to a specified set of Google Cloud projects. In this scenario, the security constraint is focused on Compute Engine instances used by Dataflow, and VPC Service Controls might be considered a bit heavy-handed for just addressing the internal IP address requirement.
---
## Q254
- Fusion optimization in Dataflow can lead to steps being "fused" together, which can sometimes hinder parallelization.
- Introducing a Reshuffle step can prevent fusion and force the distribution of work across more workers.
- This can be an effective way to improve parallelism and potentially trigger the autoscaler to increase the number of workers.
Fusion occurs when multiple transformations are fused into a single stage, which can limit parallelism and hinder performance, especially in streaming pipelines. By introducing a Reshuffle step, you break fusion and allow for better parallelism.
