Question #21
Topic 1
Your company uses a proprietary system to send inventory data every 6 hours to a data ingestion service in the cloud. Transmitted data includes a payload of several fields and the timestamp of the transmission. If there are any concerns about a transmission, the system re-transmits the data. How should you deduplicate the data most efficiency?
A. Assign global unique identifiers (GUID) to each data entry. Most Voted
B. Compute the hash value of each data entry, and compare it with all historical data.
C. Store each data entry as the primary key in a separate database and apply an index.
D. Maintain a database table to store the hash value and other metadata for each data entry. Most Voted
 
To deduplicate the data efficiently in this scenario, the best approach would be:

### **A. Assign global unique identifiers (GUID) to each data entry.**

### Explanation:
Using GUIDs (or UUIDs) ensures that each entry is uniquely identifiable, making it easy to track and manage individual data entries. This method allows you to quickly check if an entry already exists in your database by simply comparing the GUIDs, which is efficient and avoids the overhead of computing hashes or managing separate hash tables.

### Other Options Considered:
- **B. Compute the hash value of each data entry**: This could work, but it requires comparing the hash against all historical data, which can be computationally expensive as the data grows.
  
- **C. Store each data entry as the primary key in a separate database**: While this might prevent duplicates, it doesnâ€™t inherently resolve the issue of managing deduplication efficiently.

- **D. Maintain a database table to store the hash value and other metadata**: This is a viable option, but it still involves additional overhead for managing the hash values and checking against them.

### Conclusion:
While options B and D have their merits, option A stands out as the most straightforward and efficient method for deduplication in this scenario. If you have more questions or need further clarification, feel free to ask!
