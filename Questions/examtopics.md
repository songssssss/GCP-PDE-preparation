Question #21
Topic 1
Your company uses a proprietary system to send inventory data every 6 hours to a data ingestion service in the cloud. Transmitted data includes a payload of several fields and the timestamp of the transmission. If there are any concerns about a transmission, the system re-transmits the data. How should you deduplicate the data most efficiency?
A. Assign global unique identifiers (GUID) to each data entry. Most Voted
B. Compute the hash value of each data entry, and compare it with all historical data.
C. Store each data entry as the primary key in a separate database and apply an index.
D. Maintain a database table to store the hash value and other metadata for each data entry. Most Voted
 
To deduplicate the data efficiently in this scenario, the best approach would be:

### **A. Assign global unique identifiers (GUID) to each data entry.**

### Explanation:
Using GUIDs (or UUIDs) ensures that each entry is uniquely identifiable, making it easy to track and manage individual data entries. This method allows you to quickly check if an entry already exists in your database by simply comparing the GUIDs, which is efficient and avoids the overhead of computing hashes or managing separate hash tables.

### Other Options Considered:
- **B. Compute the hash value of each data entry**: This could work, but it requires comparing the hash against all historical data, which can be computationally expensive as the data grows.
  
- **C. Store each data entry as the primary key in a separate database**: While this might prevent duplicates, it doesnâ€™t inherently resolve the issue of managing deduplication efficiently.

- **D. Maintain a database table to store the hash value and other metadata**: This is a viable option, but it still involves additional overhead for managing the hash values and checking against them.

### Conclusion:
While options B and D have their merits, option A stands out as the most straightforward and efficient method for deduplication in this scenario. If you have more questions or need further clarification, feel free to ask!

## Q41

For READ operation it's is correct. i.e. Date#Device (so that data read from single node) -
For write operation it should be DeviceID#Date (so that data write via multiple nodes)

The strategy you've outlined for optimizing read and write operations in Google Cloud Bigtable by structuring the row key differently for reads and writes is a common and effective approach known as "time series data modeling." This approach aims to improve read and write performance by considering the access patterns of the data.

### Read Operation - Date#Device:

- **Row Key Format: Date#Device**
  - When designing the row key for read operations, you've chosen to structure it as Date#Device.
  - This design allows you to efficiently retrieve data for a specific date and device together.
  - By combining the date and device in the row key, you can read data from a single node, enhancing read performance for queries that require data related to a specific date and device.

### Write Operation - DeviceID#Date:

- **Row Key Format: DeviceID#Date**
  - For write operations, you've chosen to structure the row key as DeviceID#Date.
  - This design aims to distribute writes across multiple nodes by including DeviceID first in the row key.
  - By starting with DeviceID in the row key, you can achieve better write scalability as writes related to different devices are spread across partitions, allowing for concurrent writes to different devices without creating hotspots.

### Benefits of this Approach:

1. **Optimized Read Performance:**
   - The Date#Device row key structure facilitates efficient retrieval of data for a specific date and device, enhancing read performance by reading from a single node.

2. **Improved Write Scalability:**
   - The DeviceID#Date row key structure helps distribute write operations across multiple nodes, improving write scalability by avoiding hotspots and allowing for concurrent writes to different devices.

3. **Balanced Data Distribution:**
   - By considering the access patterns for reads and writes, this approach balances data distribution and optimizes performance for both operations.

4. **Query Flexibility:**
   - The chosen row key formats provide flexibility for querying data based on either date or device, supporting different types of queries efficiently.

By structuring the row key differently for read and write operations in Google Cloud Bigtable based on the specific requirements of your application, you can optimize performance, scalability, and overall efficiency when reading and writing time series data.
