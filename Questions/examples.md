For storing 50 TB of frequently updated financial time-series data and supporting Apache Hadoop jobs for insights, **Cloud Bigtable** is the most appropriate choice. Hereâ€™s an overview of each of the mentioned products and why Cloud Bigtable stands out for this use case:

### 1. **Cloud Bigtable**

- **Function**: Cloud Bigtable is a fully managed, scalable NoSQL database service designed for large analytical and operational workloads. It is optimized for time-series data, real-time analytics, and large-scale data storage.
- **Use Case**: It is ideal for storing large amounts of time-series data, such as financial data, because it efficiently handles high write throughput and large read volumes. Cloud Bigtable is well-suited for applications that require low-latency access to data and can scale horizontally to handle high data ingestion rates.
- **Features**: 
  - Handles large volumes of data and high request rates.
  - Suitable for time-series data, where data is continuously updated and needs to be queried efficiently.
  - Integrates with Apache Hadoop and other data processing frameworks.
  - Provides high availability and reliability.

### 2. **Google BigQuery**

- **Function**: Google BigQuery is a fully managed, serverless data warehouse designed for large-scale data analytics. It enables fast SQL queries using the processing power of Google's infrastructure.
- **Use Case**: BigQuery is excellent for running complex queries and performing analytics on large datasets. However, it is more suited for analytical workloads rather than real-time, frequently updated data ingestion.
- **Features**: 
  - Designed for interactive analysis and querying of large datasets.
  - Supports SQL queries and integrates well with data visualization tools.
  - Best for running analytical queries rather than serving as a primary store for continuously streaming data.

### 3. **Google Cloud Storage**

- **Function**: Google Cloud Storage is a scalable object storage service for storing and accessing any amount of data. It is designed for high durability and availability.
- **Use Case**: Ideal for storing large volumes of unstructured data, such as backups, data archives, and media. It is not optimized for high-frequency updates or low-latency access for time-series data.
- **Features**: 
  - Provides high durability and availability.
  - Suitable for archiving and backup rather than real-time data ingestion and analytics.
  - Data retrieval can be slower compared to specialized databases for real-time use cases.

### 4. **Google Cloud Datastore**

- **Function**: Google Cloud Datastore is a fully managed NoSQL document database designed for web and mobile applications. It provides a hierarchical data model and is suitable for applications requiring flexible schema and high availability.
- **Use Case**: Datastore is ideal for applications with flexible schema requirements and those needing automatic scaling. However, it is not optimized for handling large volumes of time-series data or high-throughput scenarios.
- **Features**: 
  - Supports hierarchical data and flexible schema.
  - Better suited for transactional data rather than large-scale time-series data.

### Recommendation

**Cloud Bigtable** is the best fit for your requirements because:

- It efficiently handles large volumes of time-series data with high write throughput and low-latency read access.
- It scales horizontally to accommodate increasing data volumes and ingestion rates.
- It integrates well with Apache Hadoop for running analytical jobs and gaining insights from your data.

While **Google BigQuery** and **Google Cloud Storage** are powerful tools for data analytics and storage, respectively, they are not as optimized for real-time data ingestion and frequent updates as Cloud Bigtable. **Google Cloud Datastore** is more suited for applications requiring flexible schema and hierarchical data rather than high-frequency time-series data.
